A simple interface for writing bots using Telepathy

Current status: Vaporware

There are plenty of libraries for writing bots for specific protocols, 
but making use of telepathy provides easy support for a large number
of different protocols. 

Specifically, I'm trying to use the link-local xmpp protocol, which
should hopefully make it easy to write bots that can work for a small
team of co-located developers who already make use of empathy to
communicate. There will be no need to start and manage a jabber server. 
This is also handy within larger companies already making use of some
sort of chat protocol. Instead of having IT create a bunch of different
accounts for bots across various teams, each team can instead use their
own local bot.
